Welcome to my profile, here you can see all the personal projects i have carried out throughout my career. I have great experience with the Go language, creating APIS for financial services that will serve a global scope. I currently work at Dock Tech, a Brazilian company who is creating this new technology for the world. Additionally, i have intermediate experience with AWS, building and monitoring EC2 instances, cloudformations, etc. I work with a lot of observability too, for example i apply span traces monitoring in our GO APIS, using datadog and i can consider that i currently know this subject very well, if you want to talk about it, call me on my personal email below this text. I also have great experience uploading the Jenkins pipeline of some APIS. I often document GO APIS, for example the global Dock product that we have been creating for many years, i worked on product documentation using the Confluence platform, so i also have experience with that. I have experience creating unit tests for endpoints and a lot of experience building clean code projects. To conclude my summary, i can say that i have great experience with building and planning code infrastructure for GO APIS and i worked with JIRA and had experience with several agile methodologies such as Kanban, SCRUM, etc.
