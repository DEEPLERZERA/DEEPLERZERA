Welcome to my profile, here you can see all the personal projects I have carried out throughout my career. I have great experience with the Go language, creating APIS for financial services that will serve a global scope. I currently work at Dock Tech, a Brazilian company who is creating this new technology for the world. Additionally, I have intermediate experience with AWS, building and monitoring EC2 instances, cloudformations, etc. I work with a lot of observability too, for example I apply span traces monitoring in our GO API, using datadog and I can consider that I currently know this subject very well, if you want to talk about it, call me on my personal email below this text. To conclude my summary, I can say that I have great experience with building and planning code infrastructure for GO APIS.
